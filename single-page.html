      <h1>What is Programming</h1>
      <p>
        Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a
        notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a
        computer. Although many programming languages and many different types
        of computer exists, the important first step is, need to have the
        solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program.

      <h1>What is Programming Language</h1>
      <p>
        A programming language is a computer language programmers use to
        develope software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for
        computers to execute.There are many programming languages, Below there
        are some popular programming languages

    <!--C Programming-->
    <div id="C">
      <h1>C</h1>
      <p>
        C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer
        programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell
        Telephone Labratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the
        most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one
        scale of popularity along with Java Programming language, which is also
        equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.
        Here are some reasons why you should learn C programming
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to learn</li>
        <li>Structured language</li>
        <li>It produces efficient programs</li>
        <li>It can handle low-level activities</li>
        <li>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms</li>

    <!--CPP-->
    <div id="CPP">
      <h1>C++</h1>
      <p>
        C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne
        Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of
        platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.
        The main idea behind the development of C++ is to overcome the drawbacks
        of C programming language. Here are some key points of C++
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Platform or Machine independent</li>
        <li>Simple and Fast</li>
        <li>Has a vast built-in libraries</li>
        <li>Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA)</li>
        <li>High-level programming language</li>
        <li>It is an Object Oriented language (OOP)</li>

    <!--Java-->
    <div id="Java">
      <h1>Java</h1>
      <p>
        Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming
        language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a
        computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure,
        and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java
        applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific
        supercomputers, cell phones, etc. Why we use Java?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi,
          etc.)
        </li>
        <li>It is one of the most popular programming language in the world</li>
        <li>It is easy to learn and simple to use</li>
        <li>It is open-source and free</li>
        <li>It is secure, fast and powerful</li>
        <li>
          It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
        </li>
        <li>
          Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to
          programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs

      <h1>Python</h1>
      <p>
        Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming
        language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further
        developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an
        emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to
        express their concepts in fewer lines of code. Python is a programming
        language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more
        efficiently. There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3.
        Both are quite different. Main features of python are

        designer of the most intelligent Java IDE, named Intellij IDEA. This is
        a strongly statically typed language that runs on JVM. In 2017, Google
        announced Kotlin is an official language for android development. Kotlin
        is an open source programming language that combines object-oriented
        programming and functional features into a unique platform. The

      <h1>Go</h1>
      <p>
        Go is a procedural programming language. It was developed in 2007 by
        Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google but launched in
        2009 as an open-source programming language. Programs are assembled by
        using packages, for efficient management of dependencies. This language
        also supports environment adopting patterns alike to dynamic languages.
        For eg., type inference (y := 0 is a valid declaration of a variable y
        of type float).Some features of Go language listed below
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generates Binaries</li>
        <li>Static typing</li>
        <li>Package management and Concurrency support</li>
        <li>Object Oriented nature</li>
        <li>Powerful standard library and Testing support</li>
